# Contributing

Thanks for taking the time to contribute.

## Getting started

Requires Node.js 20 or newer (see `engines` in `package.json`).

```bash
git clone https://github.com/SifisoScS/ts-package-template.git
cd ts-package-template
npm ci
```

**Use `npm ci`, never a bare `npm install`.** Beyond giving you exactly the
locked tree that CI uses, `npm install` resolves optional dependencies against
_your_ machine and rewrites `package-lock.json` without the native bindings
other platforms need. Jest pulls in such bindings, so committing a lockfile
produced that way breaks CI for everyone on a different OS.

A pre-commit hook and a CI step both guard against this. Run `npm run prepare`
once to enable the hook (it points `core.hooksPath` at `.githooks/`); `npm ci`
does it for you. To check by hand:

```bash
npm run check-lockfile
```

Let Dependabot or CI own `package-lock.json`.

### Changing dependencies on Windows

You cannot. `npm install`, `npm uninstall` and even
`npm install --package-lock-only` all rewrite the lockfile against the current
machine and drop packages other platforms need — including transitive ones that
carry no platform metadata of their own. The guard catches this, but there is no
local repair: the only fix is `git checkout -- package-lock.json`.

To add or remove a dependency, either let Dependabot do it, or regenerate the
lockfile on Linux (WSL, a container, or a CI job).

## Scripts

| Script                   | What it does                                    |
| ------------------------ | ----------------------------------------------- |
| `npm run build`          | Compiles `src/` to `dist/`                      |
| `npm test`               | Runs the Jest suite                             |
| `npm run test:coverage`  | Runs tests and enforces the coverage thresholds |
| `npm run lint`           | ESLint, including type-aware rules              |
| `npm run type-check`     | Type-checks the production and test projects    |
| `npm run format`         | Formats with Prettier                           |
| `npm run check-lockfile` | Fails if package-lock.json is platform-pruned   |

Before opening a pull request, run the same checks CI does:

```bash
npm run check-lockfile && npm run format:check && npm run lint && npm run type-check && npm run test:coverage && npm run build
```

## Project layout

- `src/` — the published source. Compiled to `dist/`, which is gitignored.
- `tests/` — Jest specs. Type-checked via `tsconfig.test.json`.
- `tsconfig.json` — production build. Deliberately excludes tests and does not
  pull in Jest's global types.
- `tsconfig.test.json` — extends the above and adds `tests/` plus Jest types.

## Standards

- **TypeScript is strict**, with several additional checks enabled. Do not
  weaken `tsconfig.json` to make an error go away.
- **Coverage floors are enforced** (90% statements, 95% branches). New code
  needs tests.
- **A bug fix needs a regression test** — one that fails against the unfixed
  code. That is the point of it.
- **No runtime dependencies.** This package has none and should keep it that
  way. Development dependencies are fine.
- **Do not commit build output.** `dist/` is generated.

## Pull requests

1. Branch from `main`.
2. Keep the change focused; unrelated cleanups belong in their own PR.
3. Update `CHANGELOG.md` under `[Unreleased]`.
4. Make sure CI is green — it runs on Node 20, 22, and 24.

## Releasing

Releases are driven by an annotated tag; there is no manual `npm publish`.

1. Move the `[Unreleased]` entries in `CHANGELOG.md` under a new version
   heading with today's date.
2. Bump the version: `npm version <major|minor|patch>`. This commits the change
   and creates a matching `vX.Y.Z` tag.
3. Push both: `git push && git push --tags`.

Pushing the tag triggers `.github/workflows/release.yml`, which re-runs every
CI check, verifies the tag matches `package.json`, and publishes with
[npm provenance](https://docs.npmjs.com/generating-provenance-statements) so the
tarball is cryptographically linked to the commit that produced it.

A tag whose version disagrees with `package.json` fails the workflow rather than
publishing something untraceable.

**There is no publish token.** The workflow authenticates to npm through
[trusted publishing](https://docs.npmjs.com/trusted-publishers/), exchanging a
short-lived GitHub OIDC token for publish rights. Nothing long-lived is stored,
so there is nothing to rotate or leak, and provenance is generated automatically.

The trusted publisher is configured on the package's npm settings page and is
pinned to this repository, the `release.yml` workflow and the `npm-publish`
environment. Renaming the workflow file or the environment will break publishing
until the npm-side configuration is updated to match.

## Reporting bugs

Open an issue with the version, a minimal reproduction, and what you expected
instead. For security problems see [SECURITY.md](SECURITY.md) — please do not
use the public issue tracker.
